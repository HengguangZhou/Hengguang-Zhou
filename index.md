I am currently a first-year Master's student at UCLA, and a project lead at [TurningPointAI](https://www.turningpoint-ai.com/), advised by [Ruochen Wang](https://ruocwang.github.io/) and Prof. [Cho-Jui Hsieh](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~chohsieh/). We are a collaborative initiative dedicated to advancing the field of Multimodal Language Agents. Learn more about our work at [TurningPointAI](https://www.turningpoint-ai.com/) and stay updated by following us on [twitter](https://x.com/TurningPointAI). 

My research is primarily focused on Multimodal Large Language Models Safety. Prior to the era of LLM, I had experiences working on 3D Computer Vision, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and visually-rich document understanding. I hold a B.S degree in Computer Science from the University of Toronto.
