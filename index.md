I am a 1st-year Master student at UCLA.

I am currently a member of ARC, an **A**IGC **R**esearch **C**ollaboration based off several labs to pursue key topics in Multimodal Language Agents, advised by [Ruochen Wang](https://ruocwang.github.io/) and Prof. [Cho-Jui Hsieh](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~chohsieh/). My research currently focuses on Multimodal Large Language Models Safety. Prior to the era of LLM, I had experiences workign on 3D Computer Vision, HCI, and visually-rich document understanding. 

I obtained my B.S. degree in Computer Science from the University of Toronto.
