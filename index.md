I am currently a first-year Master's student at UCLA.

I am currently a member of ARC, an **A**IGC **R**esearch **C**ollaboration aims to explore key topics in Multimodal Language Agents and eventually productizing the results, advised by [Ruochen Wang](https://ruocwang.github.io/) and Prof. [Cho-Jui Hsieh](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~chohsieh/). My research is primarily focused on Multimodal Large Language Models Safety. Prior to the era of LLM, I had experiences working on 3D Computer Vision, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and visually-rich document understanding. 

I hold a B.S degree in Computer Science from the University of Toronto.
